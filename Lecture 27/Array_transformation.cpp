// Given an initial array arr, every day you produce a new array using the array of the previous day.

// On the i-th day, you do the following operations on the array of day i-1 to produce the array of day i:

// If an element is smaller than both its left neighbor and its right neighbor, then this element is incremented.
// If an element is bigger than both its left neighbor and its right neighbor, then this element is decremented.
// The first and last elements never change.
// After some days, the array does not change. Return that final array.



// Example 1:

// Input: arr = [6,2,3,4]
// Output: [6,3,3,4]
// Explanation:
// On the first day, the array is changed from [6,2,3,4] to [6,3,3,4].
// No more operations can be done to this array.
// Example 2:

// Input: arr = [1,6,3,4,3,5]
// Output: [1,4,4,4,4,5]
// Explanation:
// On the first day, the array is changed from [1,6,3,4,3,5] to [1,5,4,3,4,5].
// On the second day, the array is changed from [1,5,4,3,4,5] to [1,4,4,4,4,5].
// No more operations can be done to this array.


// Constraints:

// 3 <= arr.length <= 100
// 1 <= arr[i] <= 100
